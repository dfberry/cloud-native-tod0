# Cloud native Todo

This repo documents my journey to solidify my cloud native understand. I'll use ChatGPT conversations to learn. This includes building a roadmap, and accomplishing each goal on the roadmap.

Steps (in their own branches): 

* [001 Cloud native](https://github.com/dfberry/cloud-native-todo/blob/001-cloud-native/001-cloud-native/readme.md): Use Copilot to learn about cloud native 
    * [Follow up](https://github.com/dfberry/cloud-native-todo/blob/001-cloud-native/001-cloud-native/followup.md) after initial publish
* [002 Developer environment setup](https://github.com/dfberry/cloud-native-todo/tree/002-developer-environment-setup): Set up local developer environment with a dev container

## Which AI to use? 

Generally, I'll use GitHub Copilot from inside Visual Studio Code for answers which are context-aware. If the answers don't align with my current understanding, I'll experiment with the conversation and the code until I think my solution is as cloud native (or cloud-agnostic) as I can get it. 

## What is cloud native? 

To me, cloud native means cloud-agnostic. The tools, processes, and code should generally work on any cloud. 

Most of my current experience is on Azure and is Azure native, which uses tools that aren't available on other clouds. This will be my fallback for expediency but won't be my first method to solve a problem.
