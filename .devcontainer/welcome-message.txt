This debian dev container image includes:
 - Docker
 - Node.js

The configuration for the dev container is in the .github/.devcontainer folder. 
ðŸŽµ By default in Codespaces this environment uses a 4-core machine. Some tests may require a larger machine. In Codespaces you can change the machine type.
