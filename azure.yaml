            # Setting an static tag for the docker image will allow us to re-build it before deploying.
            # This strategy works around the `azd up` order, where package is called before provision, and the image created by package is used by deploy.
            ### If the tag is not static, calling package from a hook would produce a new unique image, which would be ignored by deploy.
            # For static-web-applications, package must happen after provision.
